# Computational Mechanics

Welcome to the Computational Mechanics repository. This repository contains various versions of code developed for the Computational Mechanics course at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

## Important Notice

- **No Further Updates**: The author will not be providing any further updates to these files.
- **Intellectual Integrity**: Please do not copy these codes without thoroughly understanding them. Mindless copying is discouraged.

## About the Course

Computational Mechanics is **the best, the most important and the most useful course** in the Engineering institution. It is crucial that you fully comprehend the material. Simply changing variable names and submitting the work is not a productive approach to learning.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and learn from the code provided in this repository. Ensure that you engage deeply with the content to maximize your learning experience.

**Note**: I highly disagree arranging coding tasks without pre-courses, that's why you could see these codes as refs.
